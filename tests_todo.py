# Query for album title and album artist

# Query for album title if above did not work

# Handle multiple albums returned from album query
## Perform look up on artist?

# When performing track lookup, handle multiple arrtists for a song

# Test for when returned track size is greater than the limit of requests

# parse_lib - test for the same song appearing twice (could be one uploaded and one added)

# Handle when a whole album had been added on GM, but Spotify has additional tracks 
#   - e.g. Hot Chip A Bath Full of Ecstasy has bonus tracks on Spotify but not GM)
#   - MAribou State Kingdom album too
# This has been implemented, but needs tests on the albums themselves instead of the lower level logic
